Welcome to the INdT Tapioca .NET Convenience library for Telepathy
==================================================================

The following module contains the INdT.Telepathy.dll library which
is a convenience library for using Telepathy from Glib# and Gtk# 
applications. It has been developed to foster the development of the
.NET Instant Messenger Landell.

The Tapioca .NET Convenience library has been developed at INdT in 
Recife, Brazil with the help of the open source communities surrounding
Tapioca and Telepathy.

The Tapioca Project is an extension to Telepathy that provides 
convenience libraries as well as additional connection managers.
