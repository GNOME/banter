                          KNOWN ISSUES:
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gecko crashes immediately when you attempt to open the "People" window
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If gecko crashes immediately when you right-click on the "People" menu
(found on the app icon running in the notification area), you have
likely not created symbolic links to the theme files.

You'll need to do the following before it will run properly:

	cd ~
	mkdir .banter
	cd .banter
	ln -s $(BANTER_INSTALL_PREFIX)/share/banter/Themes Themes

This will create a symbolic link to the installed Themes to your home
directory.  Yes, this will eventually change to where you don't have to
do that anymore.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
telepathy-gabble continues to run even after you stop banter
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We haven't gotten around to cleaning up nicely (apparently) because
telepathy-gabble will continue to run if Banter ever crashes.

Before starting banter again, please kill the telepathy-gabble process.
