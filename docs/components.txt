High level breakdown of components 

Mission Control
Control loading and unloading of all telepathy connection managers and streaming frameworks
Initially we need to load gabble, tp-sofiasip and the telepathy-stream-engine. Those stacks
give us the Jabber protocol for Text IM and SIP, RTP for VOIP and VIDEO.

Presence Engine
Maintain in memory state of contact presence across all authenticated connection managers.
Must aggregate presence from the different connection managers and present a single presence
for each user.

Account Management
UI Component to manage accounts - initially we need Jabber and SIP

Chat Window
UI Component for Text, Voip and Video chatting.

Messaging Engine
Do we pump all messages through a common d-bus based engine which the
logger and third party apps can hook and leverage?  For simplicity our app
could be self contained and then later we could pump messages.

Logging
Component to handle all persistent messages in the system.  
Is voice and video recording part of this component or separate?  The
start and stop recording messages could contain meta data tha points to
the actual archive of the recording.  Export d-bus api so this information is
accessable througout the system

People Presentation 
UI Component to present and manage groups (circles) of People to collaborate with.
Initially investigate the use of the SLAB framework

Person Widget
Person UI widget that presents contact information, capabilities, hot buttons and presence
